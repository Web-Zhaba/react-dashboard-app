# DashApp
### My first project in React.
A dashboard website for placing widgets of various types on a board.
React concepts such as 
- useCallback, 
- useEffect,
- useState,
- useMemo
- memo,
- custom hooks, etc. were developed.

## Still in development, so some features (like saving layout or news widget) may not work or only work on localhost!
